Title: Gaussian Mixture Modeling Algorithms and the Belief-Based Mixture Modeling
Version: 1.8.6
Author: Przemyslaw Biecek and Ewa Szczurek
Description: Two partially supervised mixture modeling methods: 
        soft-label and belief-based modeling are implemented.
        For completeness, we equipped the package also with the
        functionality of unsupervised, semi- and fully supervised
        mixture modeling.  The package can be applied also to selection
        of the best-fitting from a set of models with different
        component numbers or constraints on their structures.
